### Testing Ionic 4

#### Usage

>Assuming We use Debian Linux

- [Install/Update Nodejs Runtime and Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install ionic globally (NEEDS SUDO)
```sh
sudo npm install -g ionic
```
- Clone this repo
```sh
clone git@github.com:mutasimissa/ionic4-test.git
```
- cd to project's directory (where package.json is placed)
- Install npm dependecies
```sh
npm install
```
- Test on your computer browser and AppDev app
```sh
ionic serve -c
```

- Test dev APK on Android emulator/device
```sh
ionic cordova run android -l
```

#### Running Tests
TODO

#### Build for Production

##### PWA:

```sh
ionic build --prod
```
Currently We disable service worker from the production build or --prod will fail

##### Andriod:
See [Ionic4 docs about Android setup](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/android)

```
